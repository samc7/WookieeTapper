Wookiee Tapper (2019)
==
This is my culminating project for my grade 11 Computer Science course. It is my second video game. The game is a remake 
of a classic arcade game,  Root Beer Tapper, with a Star Wars theme. There are math questions after every few rounds, 
which must be answered to progress through the game.

## The Story 
Youâ€™re a bartender on Kashyyyk, serving Wookiee Juice to thirsty Wookies. Wookies are known to have infinite thirst, so they
repeatedly come back for more Juice. You are the only bartender available to slide Juice down the four lanes to Wookies, and 
you must make sure you recollect their mugs as you do not have an infinite stash.
